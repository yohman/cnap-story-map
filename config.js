            description: '<p> Our interest in CNAP is rooted in our work within, and with, tenant organizing in Los Angeles. A landmark 2017 CNAP case involving a massive residential complex, Chesapeake Apartments, first alerted us to the use of nuisance abatement in the governance of property and tenancy. Shayla Myers, who represented the tenants in the Chesapeake case provided invaluable guidance in this research. We filed a public records request in 2018 for CNAP cases starting in 2013, when the current LA City Attorney, Mike Feuer, took office. After many months of stalling, we received a list of addresses and then, after much persistence, 96 CNAP complaints as a pile of paper documents, which we then had to scan and digitize. </p> <p> Subsequently, information activist, Michael Kohlhaas, shared with us CNAP complaints that date back to 2010, giving us a total of 121 cases. With the guidance of Shayla Myers, public interest lawyer, we selected 27 cases for which we obtained all legal documents, including injunctions, settlements, and judgments. </p> <p> Our interviews with Jonathan Cristall, Assistant City Attorney in charge of CNAP, drew our attention to a related eviction program, VACATE. Cristall’s office provided the 38 VACATE letters filed in 2019. </p> <p> Given the secrecy that shrouds such data in Los Angeles, we cannot definitively assert that these CNAP cases and VACATE letters comprise the full universe of filings. However, case counts in various City Attorney reports and presentations indicate that what we have is close to a full set. Of course, there is an entire world of police surveillance records, e.g. the Consolidated Crime Analysis Database, and prosecutorial documents, e.g. CNAP “demand letters,” that serve as important background to such filings. We were unable to procure demand letters, which are nuisance warnings sent to property owners, since there is currently a lawsuit pending over access to such data. </p> <p> Finally, keenly aware that tenants have no standing in programs like CNAP, we have sought out archives from other bureaucracies, such as the Los Angeles Housing and Community Investment Department (HCID-LA), where we accessed records of tenant complaints. This work is done with the intention to repair the record by centering voices of tenants in processes that have otherwise moved forward without any accountability to tenant experiences and contributions. </p>',
